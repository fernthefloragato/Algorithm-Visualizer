To-do (no-order):
1. Light and Dark mode
2. Text boxes explaining each sort
3. Better UI
4. Add statistics to track different info about the sort:
    - Number of comparisions
    - Number of swaps
    - Total time divided by set delay time


Algorithms to support:
- Bianry tree traversal (BFS, DFS, Postfix/Prefix/Infix)
